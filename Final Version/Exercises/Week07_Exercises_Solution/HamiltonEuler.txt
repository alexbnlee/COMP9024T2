In Figure 1:
 i. Is there an Eulerian cycle? No.
 ii. Is there an Eulerian path? Yes. BAGFECFADCBD
 iii. Is there a Hamiltonian cycle? Yes. BAGFECDB
 iv. Is there a Hamiltonian path? Yes. BAGFECD
  * note, if it has a Ham. cycle, it must have a path

In Figure 2:
 i. Is there an Eulerian cycle? Yes. AGFADCFECBA
 ii. Is there an Eulerian path? No.
  * note, Euler cycles and paths are mutually exclusive
 iii. Is there a Hamiltonian cycle? No.
 iv. Is there a Hamiltonian path? Yes. BAGFECD
  * note, if it has no Ham. cycle, it may or may not have a path

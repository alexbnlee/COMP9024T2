1. Graph Fundamentals

a. path
	smallest: any path with one edge (e.g. a-b or g-m)
	largest: some path including all nodes (e.g. m-g-h-k-i-j-a-b-c-d-e-f)
b. cycle
	smallest: need at least 3 nodes (e.g. i-j-k-i or h-i-k-h)
	largest: path including most nodes (e.g. g-h-k-i-j-a-b-c-d-e-f-g) (can't involve m)
c. spanning tree
	smallest: any spanning tree must include all nodes (the largest path above is an example)
	largest: same
d. vertex degree
	smallest: there is a node that has degree 1 (vertex m)
	largest: in this graph, 5 (b or f)
e. clique
	smallest: any vertex by itself is a clique of size 1
	largest: this graph has a clique of size 5 (nodes b,c,d,e,f)

 a. DFS visited = {0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8}
  It is tempting to say that the path is indicated by the visited array, but this is wrong,
  as we shall see.
 b. DFS visited = {0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8}
  This array is the same as the previous. Clearly the path from vertex 0 to 8 cannot
  include edge 7--8, so the visited array does not indicate a path.

The visited arrays are the same because 'backtracking' is not visible in the visited array:
 * when DFS reaches vertex 5, it places vertex 8 on the stack, and continues with vertex 4
 * when DFS reaches vertex 7, this branch traversal concludes, and it continues with
   the vertex 8 that remains on the stack
 * it does not matter whether there is an edge 7-8 or not, the visited arrays are identical

Conclusion: a visited array does not show the path
